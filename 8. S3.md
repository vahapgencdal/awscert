# S3
* Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
* Buckets must have a globally unique name
* Buckets are defined at the region level
* Naming convention
  * No uppercase
  * No underscore
  * 3-63 characters long
  * Not an IP
  * Must start with lowercase letter or number
 * Objects (files) have a Key 
 * The key is the FULL path: 
   * s3://my-bucket/folder/my_file.txt; key is : folder/my_file.txt
 * If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
 * S3 Access is not Region based it is global 
 * Bucket name must be unique and not contain empty space and uppercase letter
 * you need to choose a Region when you create a Bucket
## Amazon S3 -Versioning
* It is enabled at the bucket level
* Same key overwrite will increment the “version”: 1, 2, 3….
* Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
* Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions
* when you delete latest version it will unhide your file with latest version 
* if you delete one version it is going to be deleted completely
## S3 Encryption for Objects
* There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3
  * SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
  * SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
  * SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys
  * Client Side Encryption 
* It’s important to understand which ones are adapted to which situation
for the exam
### SSE-S3
SSE-S3: encryption using keys handled & managed by Amazon S3
* Object is encrypted server side
* AES-256 encryption type
* Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
  ![SSE-S3](/images/SSE-S3.PNG "SSE-S3") 
### SSE-KMS
SSE-S3: encryption using keys handled & managed by Amazon S3
* Object is encrypted server side
* AES-256 encryption type
* Must set header: “x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
  
  ![SSE-KMS](/images/SSE-KMS.PNG "SSE-KMS")   
### SSE-C
SSE-C: server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS
* Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key you provide
* HTTPS must be used
* Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made
* Cleint send ecryption key with header 
  ![SSE-C](/images/SSE-C.PNG "SSE-C") 

### Client Side Encryption
 * Client library such as the Amazon S3 Encryption Client 
 * Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3 
 * Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3 
 * Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle

    ![CLIENT-SIDE-ENC](/images/CLIENT-SIDE-ENC.PNG "CLIENT-SIDE-ENC") 
### Hands on 
* you can use default settings to when you try to upload anything will be encypted
* go to bucket-> properties and enable default encyption
### S3 Security
* User based
  * IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
* Resource Based
  * Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  * Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain
  * Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common
* an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
  * the user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
  * AND there’s no explicit DENY
### S3 Bucket Policies
* JSON based policies 
  * Resources: buckets and objects 
  * Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny 
  * Effect: Allow / Deny 
  * Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
* Use S3 bucket for policy to: 
  * Grant public access to the bucket 
  * Force objects to be encrypted at upload 
  * Grant access to another account (Cross Account) 
### Bucket settings for Block Public Access
Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies
* These settings were created to prevent company data leaks
* If you know your bucket should never be public, leave these on
* Can be set at the account level
* Networking:
  * Supports VPC Endpoints (for instances in VPC without www internet)
* Logging and Audit:
  * S3 Access Logs can be stored in other S3 bucket
  * API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail
* User Security:
  * MFA Delete: MFA (multi factor authentication) can be required in versioned buckets to delete objects
  * Pre-Signed URLs: URLs that are valid only for a limited time (ex: premium video service for logged in users)

### Bucket policy Hands on
* goto Buckets Permissions, Bucket Policy and Edit
* Click polciy Generator 
  * Policy Type : S3
  * Effect: Deny
  * Principal :anyone(*)
  * Actions : PutObject
  * ARN: copy from Bucket Polcy Page **Bucket ARN** : arn:aws:s3:::thetrainingbucket/*
  * and then : we are trying to do that for some requests which one hasnt any encyption:header
    * Condition :null
    * Key :s3-amz-server-side-encyption
    * Value : true
* so we are going to deny all put request without  s3-amz-server-side-encyption header
* and we need deny all put requests for which header value not equal AES256
  * Policy Type : S3
  * Effect: Deny
  * Principal :anyone(*)
  * Actions : PutObject
  * ARN: copy from Bucket Polcy Page **Bucket ARN** : arn:aws:s3:::thetrainingbucket/*
    * Condition :StringNotEquals
    * Key :s3-amz-server-side-encyption
    * Value : AES256
* for testing disable default encyption and then try without:s3 encyption and try with it 
* then try with KMS encyption
*
