## RDS
### 1. AWS RDS Overview 
* RDS stands for Relational Database Service
* It’s a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language
* It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
* Supported Databases
  * Postgres
  * MySQL
  * MariaDB
  * Oracle
  * Microsoft SQL Server
  * Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)
### 2. Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2
* RDS is a managed service:
  * Automated provisioning, OS patching
  * Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
  * Monitoring dashboards
  * Read replicas for improved read performance
  * Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
  * Maintenance windows for upgrades
  * Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
  * Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1) 
* BUT you can’t SSH into your instances
### 3. RDS Backups
* Backups are automatically enabled in RDS
* Automated backups:
  * Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window)
  * Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
  * => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
  * 7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days)
* DB Snapshots:
  * Manually triggered by the user
  * Retention of backup for as long as you want  
### 4. RDS Read Replicas for read scalability 
it's going to be extremely important to understand the difference between RDS Read Replicas.    
  ![RDS](/images/RDS.PNG "RDS") 
* **Up to 5 Read Replicas**
* **Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region**
* **Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent**
* **Replicas can be promoted to their own DB**
* **Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas**
### 4. RDS Read Replicas -Use Cases
* You have a production database that is taking on normal load
* You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
* You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there
* The production application is unaffected
* Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### 5. RDS Read Replicas – Network Cost 
* in AWS there’s a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
* To reduce the cost, you can have your Read Replicas in the same AZ

### 6. RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)
* SYNC replication
* One DNS name – automatic app failover to standby
* Increase availability
* Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
* No manual intervention in apps
* Not used for scaling
* The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR)

 ### 7. RDS Hands-on
  * go to Services, search RDS and then create Databases
  * Click Standart Create
  * Choose MYSQL
  * in Templates part
  * choose someone- you can choose Free Tier
  * and type name, user and pass in settings 
  * chooose db.t2.micro free version
  * Storage skip it
  * Availability and Durability is disabled for Free Tier
  * Connectivity is about Network VPC
  * Databse shouldnt be accessible for public
  * Security Group create new one 
  * and choose AZ
  * then port
  * in additional part choose initial database name
  * Enable Auto backup and you can specify in how many days
  * you can choose auto-update database
  * then click create database
  * after database creation copy the endpoint username and password and try to connect from MYSQL workbench or any other IDE
 ### 7. RDS Security - Encryption
  1. At rest encryption
     * Possibility to encrypt the master & read replicas with AWS KMS - AES-256 encryption
     * Encryption has to be defined at launch time
     * If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
     * Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) available for Oracle and SQL Server
#### RDS Encryption Operations
1. Encrypting RDS backups
   * Snapshots of un-encrypted RDS databases are un-encrypted
   * Snapshots of encrypted RDS databases are encrypted
   * Can copy a snapshot into an encrypted one
2. To encrypt an un-encrypted RDS database
   * Create a snapshot of the un-encrypted database
   * Copy the snapshot and enable encryption for the snapshot
   * Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot
   * Migrate applications to the new database, and delete the old database  

3. RDS - IAM Authentication
   * IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL
   * You don’t need a password, just an authentication token obtained through IAM & RDS API calls
   * Auth token has a lifetime of 15 minutes
   * Benefits
     * Network in/out must be encrypted using SSL
     * IAM to centrally manage users instead of DB
     * Can leverage IAM Roles and EC2 Instance profiles for easy integration
4. RDS Security – Summary 
* Encryption at rest:
  * Is done only when you first create the DB instance
  * or: unencrypted DB => snapshot => copy snapshot as encrypted => create DB from snapshot
* Your responsibility:
  * Check the ports / IP / security group inbound rules in DB’s SG
  * In-database user creation and permissions or manage through IAM
  * Creating a database with or without public access
  * Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connections
* AWS responsibility:
  * No SSH access
  * No manual DB patching
  * No manual OS patching
  * No way to audit the underlying instance
## Amazon Auro
* Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
* Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database)
* Aurora is “AWS cloud optimized” and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
* Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 64 TB. 
* Aurora can have 15 replicas while MySQL has 5, and the replication process is faster (sub 10 ms replica lag)
* Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It’s HA (High Availability) native. 
* Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) – but is more efficient
1. ### Aurora High Availability and Read Scaling
* 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ:
  * 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
  * 3 copies out of 6 need for reads
  * Self healing with peer-to-peer replication
  * Storage is striped across 100s of volumes
* One Aurora Instance takes writes (master)
* Master + up to 15 Aurora Read Replicas serve reads
* Support for Cross Region Replication

2. ### Features of Aurora
* Automatic fail-over
* Backup and Recovery
* Isolation and security
* Industry compliance
* Push-button scaling
* Automated Patching with Zero Downtime
* Advanced Monitoring
* Routine Maintenance
* Backtrack: restore data at any point of time without using backups
3. ### Aurora Security
* Similar to RDS because uses the same engines
* Encryption at rest using KMS
* Automated backups, snapshots and replicas are also encrypted
* Encryption in flight using SSL (same process as MySQL or Postgres)
* Possibility to authenticate using IAM token (same method as RDS)
* You are responsible for protecting the instance with security groups
* You can’t SSH
4. ### Aurora Serverless
Automated database instantiation and auto - scaling based on actual usage
* Good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workloads
* No capacity planning needed
* Pay per second, can be more cost-effective

5. ### Global Aurora
* Aurora Cross Region Read Replicas
  * Useful for disaster recovery
  * Simple to put in place
* Aurora Global Database (recommended)
  * 1 Primary Region (read / write) 
  * Up to 5 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second
  * Up to 16 Read Replicas per secondary region
  * Helps for decreasing latency
  * Promoting another region (for disaster recovery) has an RTO of < 1 minute
## Elastic Cache
### Amazon ElastiCache Overview
* The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases…
* ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached
* Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency
* Helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
* Helps make your application stateless
* AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups
* Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes

### ElastiCache Solution Architecture - DB Cache
* Applications queries ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache
* Helps relieve load in RDS
* Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in there. 

![EC-SA-DB-CACHE](/images/EC-SA-DB-CACHE.PNG "EC-SA-DB-CACHE")  
### ElastiCache Solution Architecture – User Session Store
User logs into any of the application
* The application writes the session data into ElastiCache
* The user hits another instance of our application
* The instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in  
![EC-SA-USS](/images/EC-SA-USS.PNG "EC-SA-USS")
### ElastiCache – Redis vs Memcached
![EC-RDS-MMCACHE](/images/EC-RDS-MMCACHE.PNG "EC-RDS-MMCACHE")  
One is going to have more industrial RDS type features so Redis is going to be more like RDS, while Memcached is going to be a pure cache.
### Lazy Loading / Cache-Aside / Lazy Population
![LL-CACHE](/images/LL-CACHE.PNG "LL-CACHE")  
### Write Through – Add or Update cache when database is updated
![WT-CACHE](/images/WT-CACHE.PNG "WT-CACHE")  
### Cache Evictions and Time-to-live (TTL)
* Cache eviction can occur in three ways:
  * You delete the item explicitly in the cache
  * Item is evicted because the memory is full and it’s not recently used (LRU)
  * You set an item time-to-live (or TTL)
* TTL are helpful for any kind of data:
  * Leaderboards
  * Comments
  * Activity streams
* TTL can range from few seconds to hours or days
* If too many evictions happen due to memory, you should scale up or out
### Final words of wisdom
 * Lazy Loading / Cache aside is easy to implement and works for many situations as a foundation, especially on the read side
* Write-through is usually combined with Lazy Loading as targeted for the queries or workloads that benefit from this optimization
* Setting a TTL is usually not a bad idea, except when you’re using Write- through. Set it to a sensible value for your application
* Only cache the data that makes sense (user profiles, blogs, etc…) 


Some Notes :
* Multi AZ keeps the same connection string regardless of which database is up. Read Replicas imply we need to reference them individually in our application as each read replica will have its own DNS name
* in read replicas you need to create new connection
