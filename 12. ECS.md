## What is Docker ?
* Well, Docker is a software development platform basically used to deploy apps and it's revolutionary, why? Because we packaged apps in something called a containers you may have heard of the term  Docker container and these containers are very special because they can be run on any OS so Linux, Mac, Windows they run the exact same way and because they run the exact same way.
* Apps run the same, regardless of where they’re run
  * Any machine
  * No compatibility issues
  * Predictable behavior
  * Less work
  * Easier to maintain and deploy
  * Works with any language, any OS, any technology
### Where Docker images are stored?
 * Docker images are stored in Docker Repositories
 * Public: Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/ 
   * Find base images for many technologies or OS: • Ubuntu • MySQL • NodeJS, Java… 
 * Private: Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)  
  
 so this is where you would store your personal images and one of these is Amazon ECR, ECR stands for Elastic Container Registry and you're supposed to know about ECR for the exam.  
 ## Docker versus Virtual Machines
 Docker is container based technology and containers are just user space of the operating system. ... A Virtual Machine, on the other hand, is not based on container technology. They are made up of user space plus kernel space of an operating system. Under VMs, server hardware is virtualized.
