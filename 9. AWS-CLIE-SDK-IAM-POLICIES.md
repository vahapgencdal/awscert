# AWS CLI, SDK, IAM Roles & Policies
1. Aws Cli Setup on windows(Write Google)
  * [you can goto that link and continue the instractions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html)
2. Aws Cli Setup on Mac(Write Google)
    * [you can goto that link and continue the instractions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html)  

### Note : If after installing the AWS CLI, you use it and you get the error 
aws; command not found : the aws executable is not in the PATH environment variable

## Configure AWS Key
* Goto your root account
* users -> Security Credenticals -> Create Access Key
* after that download as CSV
* then goto your own computer
* and write terminal **aws configure**
* will ask **AWS Access Key Id** copy from cvs paste enter
* will ask **AWS Secret Access Key** copy from cvs
*  will ask default region name : where is your default account goto your aws account copy from right upper part mine is **us-east-2** 
* default output format keep empty and pass it
* ls ~/.aws
* if you go inside of config you will see default region
* and in the credentical key id and secret
## AWS CLI ON EC2
This is for run aws-cli to ec2
1. THE BAD WAY
   * We could run `aws configure` on EC2 just like we did (and it’ll work)
   * NEVER EVER EVER PUT YOUR PERSONAL CREDENTIALS ON AN EC2
   * Your PERSONAL credentials are PERSONAL and only belong on your PERSONAL computer
   * If the EC2 is compromised, so is your personal account
   * If the EC2 is shared, other people may perform AWS actions while impersonating you
   * For EC2, there’s a better way… it’s called AWS IAM Roles
2. THE RIGHT WAY
   * IAM Roles can be attached to EC2 instances
   * IAM Roles can come with a policy authorizing exactly what the EC2 instance should be able to do
   * EC2 Instances can then use these profiles automatically without any additional configurations
   * This is the best practice on AWS and you should 100% do this
### Hands on 
we created a role with s3-full-access and s3-read-access and then assigned to instances 
with that one we can do some manupulations on S3 via EC2
- we dont need to create aws-configuratons for that because we have roles to do it with permissions : best practice
## AWS CLI Practice with S3
you can find command with [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* aws s3 ls : list of s3 buckets
* aws s3 ls s3://thetrainingbucket : list of items in trainingbucket
* aws s3 cp s3://thetrainingbucket/coffee.jpg to ./coffee.jpg :  download file from bucket
* aws s3 mb s3://thetrainingbucket1 : for make bucket
* aws s3 rb s3://thetrainingbucket1 : for remove bucket
## IAM Roles and Policies Hands on
here we are going to create own policy 
* firstly we are going to chooce a service : S3
* then we are going to chooce actions : All S3 actions : S3:*
* or you can chooce just Read: GetObject 
* then we are going to chooce Resources; here we can give specific ARN: thebucket or full access all ARN, the object name : *
```script
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "s3:GetObject",
              "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::thetrainingbucket/*"
          }
      ]
  }
```
you can do wuth AWs policy generator but best practice is Visual Pilcy Generator
* Type of Policy :IAM
* Service: S3
* actions : Getobject
* resource : *  
then we are going to attach our poluicy to role
### Hands on
for test our policy we need to detach other policies from role
you can test that with [AWS Similator Role](https://policysim.aws.amazon.com/home/index.jsp?#)
## AWS Cli Dry Run
* Sometimes, we’d just like to make sure we have the permissions…
* But not actually run the commands!
* Some AWS CLI commands (such as EC2) can become expensive if they succeed, say if we wanted to try to create an EC2 Instance
* run ec2 instances like below  : we are not authorized to run below command because we are using --dry-run command
  so here we are tesing we have permissins to do that or not it like test: **aws ec2 run-instances --dry-run --image-id ami-09558250a3419e7d0  --instance-type t2.micro**
* When you run API calls and they fail, you can get a long error message
* This error message can be decoded using the STS command line:
  * sts decode-authorization-message
  Example :
  ```script
  aws sts decode-authorization-message --encoded-message  zG7o87is0VDwe3OQOBDZ80YrcMzbzcLsxdwK-2r2lKygygd67f1jBc3I1gq59J97IS_ezuuvUZaqlVFR                                     qIWyTNonNndl6fhRgJg1IrXHwxY_Y2t3OUOsjnS_RU87AM3_F3CbBElEQ-EKZlUFFRHA8aqJPQR1OzJVJrz-r7Jrk8-JQCuSBz7HurcxLGhnhEmDHdwk7yl56U3TRr                                     qoj0-XGsxC1Khuy9WEfwlyDG2fjEjKpWBVfwbrk2QDRG_FcAeAmYBrnPhLf-VsUj0hlVUfnK65YORt_NAvHUSKHVT5GzEpzGBkIqw6jLXmxe3tXzmAFBPD8fJPK0dS                                     sYgz41iFW5uvab5gGbOgudt5maWFgG4tqz_Ie-ETeSBv8rW0mBqhlI8bWGFiXpRCWviwukKlHFpY1fhsBXbhk67V-rMwyXot5r5yxNAGmjy2mrn-wflmgd0LJlPPlj                                     w8074j2ublsz_SnOpzYknWZsZAZkR8MVNU16RfDfZJHL5mISQ9BwVo4mBSSRZ8UdfpLmhrrVc5aRN1m0jywtxT52J07w1-dikDFQ3RU1F8Rx8Rdd9MHOVwPWA1sMyG                                     CPKpmkiWv2s7fzmQrTmPyfCGPUp9pj0gs1PvQRdTFuQ_p91eXgQZYVPWesIHT-FQOvKQyGVm2VEpv3f-76mBSuoOG9REx3C31faHnuA-zOXD7cOPgTJFmA
  ```
  for decode message you also need to goto roles and add right permission to decode messages
  or you can create own permission to decode.
## Aws EC2 Instance Metadata
It basically allows your EC2 instances to learn about themselves, so they don't have to use an IAM role for that purpose. and also you can find them yourself
* just goto instance and command **curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data**
## AWS Cli Profiles
if you have many accounts for manage Ec2 you can continue with profile because many user can login system
* for create other profile : ** aws configure --profile my-other-aws-account
* and then ls credenticals will show more
## AWS Cli MFA
* To use MFA with the CLI, you must create a temporary session
* To do so, you must run the STS GetSessionToken API call
* aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn-of-the-mfa-device --tokencode code-from-token --duration-seconds 3600
## AWS Limits (Quotas)
* API Rate Limits
  * DescribeInstances API for EC2 has a limit of 100 calls per seconds
  * GetObject on S3 has a limit of 5500 GET per second per prefix
  * For Intermittent Errors: implement Exponential Backoff
  * For Consistent Errors: request an API throttling limit increase
* Service Quotas (Service Limits)
  * Running On-Demand Standard Instances: 1152 vCPU
  * You can request a service limit increase by opening a ticket
  * You can request a service quota increase by using the Service Quotas API
## NOte
* If you get ThrottlingException intermittently, use exponential backoff
* The IAM Instance Profile was assigned to the EC2 instance, but it still had access to all S3 buckets. Why?  
  the credentials chain is still giving priorities to the environment variables.
