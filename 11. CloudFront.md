# AWS CloudFront
* Content Delivery Network (CDN)
* Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
* 216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
* DDoS protection, integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall
* Can expose external HTTPS and can talk to internal HTTPS backends
## CloudFront– Origins
* S3 bucket 
  * For distributing files and caching them at the edge 
  * Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) 
  * CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
* Custom Origin (HTTP) 
  * Application Load Balancer 
  * EC2 instance 
  * S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website) 
  * Any HTTP backend you want
 ## Cloudfront at a high level
 Okay, how this platform work at a high level. So we have a bunch of edge locations all around the globe.
And they're connected to the origin we defined,it could be an S3 buckets or it could be any HTTP endpoints
and our clients wants to access our CloudFront distribution. For doing this, the client will send an HTTP request directly into CloudFront and this is what an HTTP request would look like. There will be a URL, some query string parameters and there will be also some headers. And then the edge location will forward the request to your origin and that includes the query strings and that includes the headers, so everything gets forwarded on to your origin. You can configure this and then your origin response to the edge location. The edge location will cache the response based on the cache settings we've defined and return the response back to our clients. T he edge location will first look into the cache before forwarding the request to the origin.

## CloudFront – S3 as an Origin
So let's look at S3 as an origin in details. So you have the cloud and you have your origin,
which is your S3 buckets. And for example, you have an edge location in Los Angeles and some users want to read some data from there. So your edge location is going to fetch the data from your S3 buckets over the private AWS network and give you the results from that edge location. The idea here is that for the edge location of CloudFront to access your S3 buckets is going to use an OAI or an origin access identity is IAM role for your CloudFront origin. And using that role is going to access your S3 buckets and the bucket policy is going to say yes, this role is accessible and yes, send the file to CloudFront. So this works as well for other edge locations for example, in Sao Paulo in Brazil, or Mumbai, or Melbourne. And so all around the world, your edge locations are going to serve cached content from your S3 buckets and so we can see how CloudFront can become super helpful as a CDN.

## CloudFront – ALB or EC2 as an origin
So we have our EC2 instance or instances and they must be public because they must be publicly accessible from HTTP standpoint and we have our users all around the world. So they will access our edge location
and our edge location will access our EC2 instance and as you can see, it traverses the security group.
So the security group must allow the IPs of CloudFront edge locations into the EC2 instance. And for this, there is a list of public IP for edge locations that you can get on this website. And the idea is that the security group must allow all these public IP of edge locations to allow CloudFront to fetch content from your EC2 instances.

![ALB-EC2-ORIGIN](/images/ALB-EC2-ORIGIN.PNG "ALB-EC2-ORIGIN")

What if we use an ALB as an origin. So now we have a security group for the a ALB and the ALB must be public to be accessible by CloudFront. But the backend EC2 instances now can be private. And so in terms of security group for the EC2 instances, EC2 allow the security group of the load balancer, we've seen this extensively. And for the edge location, which are again, public locations, it needs to access your ALB through the public network. And so that means that your security group for your ALB must allow the public IP of the edge locations the same public IP as we had from before. So two different architectures, same concept
## CloudFront Geo Restriction
* You can restrict who can access your distribution
  * Whitelist: Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the countries on a list of approved countries.
  * Blacklist: Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on a blacklist of banned countries.
* The “country” is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP database
* Use case: Copyright Laws to control access to content
## CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
* CloudFront:
  * Global Edge network
  * Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
  * Great for static content that must be available everywhere
* S3 Cross Region Replication:
  * Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
  * Files are updated in near real-time
  * Read only
  * Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
 ## CloudFront Signed URL / Signed Cookies
 * You want to distribute paid shared content to premium users over the world
 * To Restrict Viewer Access, we can create a CloudFront Signed URL / Cookie
 * How long should the URL be valid for?
 * Shared content (movie, music): make it short (a few minutes)
 * Private content (private to the user): you can make it last for years
 * Signed URL = access to individual files (one signed URL per file)
 * Signed Cookies = access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files)
## CloudFront Signed URL Diagram 
Now how does signed URL work as a diagram?
So we have our CloudFront distribution and has a bunch of edge locations and for example we seen before we can access our S3 bucket through OAI, so Origin Access Identity for full security. And so that means the objects in our S3 bucket cannot be accessed by anything else, but CloudFront, but we still want to be able to give people access to their objects through CloudFronts. So we have our clients and our client is going
to authorize and authenticate to our application and we have to code that application. And our application will use the AWS SDK to generate a signed URL directly from CloudFront. It will return the signed URL to the clients and then the client will be able to use that signed URL to get the data and files and objects or whatever he needs directly from CloudFront.
