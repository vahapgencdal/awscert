# Route 53
## AWS Route 53 Overview
Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System) 
In AWS, the most common records are:
* A: hostname to IPv4 ,for example host to ec2
* AAAA: hostname to IPv6 
* CNAME: hostname to hostname for example www
* Alias: hostname to AWS resource. for example host to loadbalancer     
  
Route53 has advanced features such as:
* Load balancing (through DNS – also called client load balancing)
* Health checks (although limited…)
* Routing policy: simple, failover, geolocation, latency, weighted, multi value
## TTL
TTL is basically a way for web browsers and clients to cache the response of a DNS query. if you set 300 seconds
it's going to be valid for 300 seconds. And any time we request myapp.mydomain.com, the web browser will just look internally, and in some cases, you will not ask Route 53 again. only after the TTL has expired And then, we will have the chance to have an updated DNS Record in our web browser.
* High TTL 24 hours -> possible outdated records
* less TTL 60 seconds -> less outdated records
## Cname vs Alias
CNAME:  
* Points a hostname to any other hostname. (app.mydomain.com => blabla.anything.com)  
* ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka. something.mydomain.com)  

Alias:
* Points a hostname to an AWS Resource (app.mydomain.com => blabla.amazonaws.com)
* Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka mydomain.com)
* Free of charge
* Native health check
## Weighted Routing Policy
* Control the % of the requests that go to specific endpoint
* Helpful to test 1% of traffic on new app version for example
* Helpful to split traffic between two regions
* Can be associated with Health Checks
## Latency Routing Policy
* Redirect to the server that has the least latency close to us
* Super helpful when latency of users is a priority
* Latency is evaluated in terms of user to designated AWS Region
* Germany may be directed to the US (if that’s the lowest latency)
## Health Checks
Health checks can be linked to Route53 DNS queries!
## Failover
when you click Failover you need Health check and you need to associate them. this good property
## Geolocation Routing policy
in geolocation when you create record you can choose country or continent
## Multi Value Routing Policy
* Use when routing traffic to multiple resources
* Want to associate a Route 53 health checks with records
* Up to 8 healthy records are returned for each Multi Value query
